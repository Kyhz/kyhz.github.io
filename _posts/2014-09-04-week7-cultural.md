The values that really stand out for me are: Accomplishment, Commitment, Excitement, Growth, Personal development, Self-respect. Staring at this list, one thing that jumps out to me is that they're all deeply personal. It may speak something about either my personality or my experiences, or both. I cannot tell. In any case, the moments I've felt the strongest positive emotions were intrinsically tied to things I accomplished (mostly) on my own. If I had to pick one of the values mentioned earlier, it would probably be Accomplishment. The feeling of having done something worthwhile is a rare and cherished one (at least in my case). Doubly so when it is acknowledged by others. In a similar vein, personal failures are also something that affect me greatly. Success or failure in groups don't elicit the same elation or despair in me. Those feelings are mitigated when others are involved ("I had help." and "We all did badly.") So maybe the value I care about the most is actually Personal Accomplishment.
It's difficult to compare the emotions you have in the best moments of your life to those you feel in general, but let's try to grade them on a 1 to 5 scale based on how much I try to live up to these values in general:

-Accomplishment: 4

I wish I could say I felt accomplished at the end of each day, but sadly I don't. It is however something that motivates me a big deal, even if it's sometimes not entirely sufficient to overcome the tremendous inertia of laziness on its own.

-Commitment: 1

I actually hate committing to things. Deciding which color toothbrush I want is something that takes me way more thought and time than I care to admit. On the plus side, it keeps me from spending money on impulse purchases!

-Excitement: 2

I don't really actively seek out excitement in my daily life. I'm usually pretty happy with having a routine and I rarely get bored on my own.

-Growth: 5

Specifically intellectual growth. I absolutely love learning things, and I always feel compelled to understand how and why things work. It's a bit of a narrow aspect of growth, but it is actually something I care a lot about.

-Personal development: 3

It's kind of strange to rate growth 5 while I rate this a 3, but I'll subvert this a bit to mean a more holistic growth, encompassing multiple aspects instead of just one. And in that regard, there are just some things that I neglect/don't care so much about. Several social and emotional aspects of personal development I simply kind of ignore. They're not things I'll shy away from, but neither do I actively seek them out.

-Self-respect: 2

While I felt tremendous pride and sense of accomplishment in the moments I alluded to above, in my day to day life it isn't really that big of a deal. If anything, I feel like I should be achieving more than I am.

The last time someone asked me for advice, it was my good friend and roommate asking for my opinion on the composition of his Magic the Gathering deck. Not exactly the most dramatic of topics, but seeing how we both share that hobby and talk about it a lot, it's not too surprising. As mundane as the topic is, I'm obviously pleased that he values my opinion (as I his). I don't really have too much else to say about this apart from Believe in the heart of the cards.
Frankly, I don't really feel all that empowered when I think of the values I listed.
