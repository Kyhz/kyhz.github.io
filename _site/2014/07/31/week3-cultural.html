		<h1>Thinking Style and Learning</h1>
		<p>31 Jul 2014</p>

	<div class="main_wrapper">
		<p>According to the Gregorc Thinking Style test, I am very firmly an Abstract Sequential thinker. While some of the descriptions are very accurate, there are some things that are less so. But then again, given the complexity of human nature, reducing it to a set of four categories always did strike me as a little ambitious. It does peg me as someone who likes to work alone, which is true, although I haven’t had any problems with pairing sessions thus far. In fact, I’ve been enjoying them for the most part. Groups being a problem for me is something I had already noticed and as I mentioned in an earlier post, something that I want to work on. I do think that pairing sessions can be good in that aspect, since they are social interactions, but since it’s one on one, there is a constant need to stay involved and focused.</p>

<p>Another characteristic that I supposedly have and will readily admit to is having trouble expressing my emotions. Even now, writing this simple blog post is taking an inordinate amount of time and mental energy from me. I don’t really know how to improve on this. I suppose these regular blog posts are a start.</p>

<p>I talk about improving and changing my attitude because I’m also trying to adopt a growth-oriented mindset. For most of my life, I’ve been stuck in the fixed mindset. Sure, I knew things can change and evolve, but that ultimately there is a limit to one’s ability. Even now I still think that, but I realize that it’s more important to focus on maximizing that potential instead of dwelling on what could have been. I’ve seen a bit how other people operate through peer pairing, and I think having different thinkstyles mixed together does make a problem easier to tackle. I would like to see how well this translates to larger groups and maybe pick up a thing or two about how others solve problems.</p>
