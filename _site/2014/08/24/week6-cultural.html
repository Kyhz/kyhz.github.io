		<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
		<p>24 Aug 2014</p>
	</header>
	<div class="main_wrapper">
		<p>I’ve been lucky enough to have been born in a very beneficial situation as far as stereotypes and prejudice are concerned. I’m a half-white, half-asian male from a middle class family. All things considered, it’s one of the most enviable positions to be in our current society. As such, I can’t say I’ve been exposed to a lot of stereotype threat compared to some people. Of course, it’s also much more likely that I have in fact been exposed to it but haven’t realized it. It’s hard for me to explain what my strategy for something I haven’t experienced on a conscious level would be, but I think I would try to distance myself from whatever social identity is at stake. Maybe it’s because I have a mixed background (born in the US but grew up in Europe, white and asian descent) but it’s been easy for me to disassociate myself from some of these things. Again, this relies on there being a conscious realization of the stereotype threat, which is not at all a given. Perhaps something that could work to mitigate those effects would be to see yourself through multiple lenses not focus so much on a single aspect.</p>

<p>As for how to interact with people given the knowledge that stereotype threat could potentially come into play, that is something I have more control over. As Dr. Steele demonstrates, the key is not to ignore the issue, but to remove the threat entirely, either by preempting the threat by saying it’s not a factor, or by emphasizing that you are referring to their own, personal work as individuals and not as members of a social group. This is especially important when giving feedback. The feedback at DBC is supposedly anonymous, but in reality it’s not too difficult to figure out who said what based on the comments and the time of posting. Although it’s not ideal for this type of situation here at DBC, double blind feedback would be one way to get rid of stereotype threat. Even telling the people that the feedback is single blind (in the sense that the reviewers don’t know who made what) should, I assume, be enough to quell feelings of stereotype threats. Then again, this is a somewhat limited solution. I’ve been much more often in a situation where I have to give feedback in person. In those cases, I think the important part once again is to acknowledge it and be upfront about it. Say something like “Hey, I understand that you may have some second thoughts about criticism given to you by a white man/a male/an atheist/whatever, but here are my honest thoughts on X.” Explicitly telling the other person that you understand the social situation effectively removes it from their consideration, since they now know that you are viewing them not as a member of their group, but as an individual. And that’s honestly all I think you need to do.</p>
