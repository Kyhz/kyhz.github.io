                <h1><a id="Programming">Why pair programming is important?</a></h1>
                <p>Pair Programming is a development technique where two programmers work together on a workstation. Compared to the traditional solo programming approach, pair programming has many advantages.
                </p>
                <p>It is believed that this produces the same amount of work as two separate programmers but with a higher quality. Further more, skills can also transferred between the two programmers, where the two have different experience and specialities. Ad-hoc training also occurs as one person shows the other some tricks, workarounds, etc.</p>
                <p>Other benefits of pair programming include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Collective code ownership</strong> - everbody gains a working knowledge of the entire codebase</li>
                    <li><strong>Mentoring</strong> - Knowledge is transferred between the junior programmers or new team members when paired with a more experienced person on the team</li>
                    <li><strong>Team cohesion</strong> - People get to know each other more quckly and learn how to work with each other</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved morale</strong> - When done well, pair programming is more more enjoyable than programming alone</li>
                </ul>

                <h1><a id="Roles">Roles</a></h1>
                <p>In the pair programming model, one person is said to be the Navigator and the other the Driver. Both work on the same problem, either in person at the same machine, or remotely like we've done here. The Navigator is charged with the writing: turning ideas into working code. The Driver's task is to give suggestions and also review the code the Navigator writes. There's also another aspect to this method, where the Driver tries to focus on the overall project and potential future problems while the Navigator can focus all his attention to the specific task at hand. Roles are not fixed, and pairs tend to change seats often.</p>

                <p><strong>Peter</strong> - So far I've enjoyed all my pairing sessions. The one that I enjoy the most is being able to bounce ideas with my pair, as well as learn from them. There isn't one session where I didn't learn anything new, and considering that I'm still a baby in my programming career, it is crucial that I'm always learning. Furthermore, it is also very enjoyable, especially when we are able to troubleshoot and resolve a bug. However, to have an effective pair programming, you really to communicate well with your partner. Both of you have to be on the same page and clearly communicate what it is you are working - communication is key here.</p>
                <p><strong>Raphael</strong> - Pairing went very smoothly for me. When I work on something on my own, I get easily distracted, but having a partner not only focuses my attention, but makes for an overall much more pleasant experience. Before actually pairing up, I thought I wouldn't enjoy being Navigator that much since I thought I would just mindlessly be writing out what the Driver told me to, but in practice it didn't feel like that at all. If anything, Navigator felt like the more proactive role while the Driver keeps track of the big picture and makes sure you don't make mistakes. At our level it's also great to have turns at these different roles since there's so much we don't know. I was able to teach a few things to Peter today and learned a few others in separate sessions, and I think those were the best parts about the pairing sessions: giving or receiving knowledge.</p>
