				<h1>On the popularity of Javascript</h1>

					<h2 class="article_subtitle">A language for the Web</h2>
					<p>JavaScript is one of the most, if not the most, popular language right now. The reason for its widespread appeal is the platform it operates on: the Web. It is a huge part of our modern life, and can only continue to grow. JS's popularity rides on the back of the Web's. JS was <em>created</em> to be used on websites and is nowadays ubiquitous. Back in the day, websites were mostly just plain text. Today, they're also still mostly text, but JavaScript lets us interact with the person viewing the page by responding to specific events and modifying the page accordingly.</p>

					<p>First of all, it will run on pretty much anything that has a web browser. Ever wondered why you can't use a Windows application on a Mac and vice-versa? Well it's because they were compiled for different operating systems, i.e translating the code into instructions readable by the OS. But JavaScript runs in the browser! That means you don't have to worry about what platform your users will be using to access your page.</p>
					<p>Don't let the -Script fool you: JS is a full-fledged language and has proven time and time again that it is very powerful. Thanks to its popularity, there is a lot of support for the language. There are tons of frameworks to make development easier, and it's very easy to find answers to problems through sites like StackOverflow.</p>
					<p>Although traditionally thought of as a "front-end" language (meaning it modified stuff visible on screen without doing any of the computational heavy-lifting), JS has forayed into the back-end world with Node.js. Most web apps used to use one language to do the actual work, with JavaScript on the side to present the data, but now you can use JavaScript on the server and write everything in the same language.</p>

					<h2 class="article_subtitle">The less good stuff</h2>
					<p>Though it is seemingly unified as the more or less unique herald of client-side scripting, the truth is more complex. As a side effect of its popularity, JS has has branched off in multiple directions. Do I do this using the Emberjs framework, or jQuery, or stick to vanilla JavaScript? While JavaScript itself seems to be here to stay, all the various extensions may not be. It is also not without security risks, which is not a trivial issue considering how widespread it is. It is also fully available to the client (a necessity to be able to run it), which is not always desirable. And of course, scripts represent an additional bandwidth cost, especially for large libraries. </p>
